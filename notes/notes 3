TODO:

-drag between lists
-dragging one item onto another makes a list where both items are a child
-show SOMETHING if the iframe doesn't work or the link insn't a link
-make "new" (new list, not new item) clear and get rid of useless buttons
-alert system (when dragging into self, let them know it was refused)
-moving item flashes on top of screen (not on mine because of frame rate?). It waits there until it has permission from the server to move
-uploading images
-post to many at once: Drag onto parent, auto post to all children
-sidebar width draggable
-able to filter by radius
-drag into a "slot" in the tree
-do some server side checking (don't just put shit user says into the DB)
-remove "zombie" page (when delete, remove )


NOPE:
dragged sample should be the height of the actual div
-minimize/maximize
-index doesn't highlight on an open page when a new page starts selecting things until the new page is refreshed.



DONE: 
multiple windows with the same name should be possable
can delete inside of a nested list
reorderable inside of own list <-------underway
more obvious indents/"level" different from selection
-make socket io port infered
-drag into tree instead of drop zone. 
-prevent text from overlapping "close" btn
