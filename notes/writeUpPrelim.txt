1) what is it?
- the pieces
- what you could do with them

2) how to set it up.
- deps.
- running it.
- running the site, clean DB, etc

3) Structure of the code
- database
-- how to clean it, its structure
- notes
-- working notes. Nothing too exciting
- tests
-- not unit tests. Early tests for various features
- server
-- web server
--- serves files, etc
-- node server
--- 2 way comm. Adds posts, removes posts, etc
--config.json
---has details about where files are
-web client
-- page favicon and dead link (sFavicon) favicon
-- placeholder
-- index/main page. Whats in the frame?
--css
--- images
--- label css files with comments
--scripts
---




to fix before ship:
- test on iphone
-- cannot reorder on touch screen
-- cannot resize on touch screen
-- page is too long (by a lot)
- test in IE/firefox/saferi/opera
--Saferi:
---cannot resize divider

- spin the wheels while waiting for new post
- sometimes, pages dont highligh when first opened/created or something
<- the first post created isnt selected.




DONE:
- grey out the nav field so people dont try to type into it! Or, merge nav field with new post field
- use a handle to move item, use regular select to copy text. Remove top field
- the name of a page isnt always the name of the page (js dom cant even do its one job!!)
- make options always visable (dont click, just use the bottom corner of the screen)
- alert on disconnect
