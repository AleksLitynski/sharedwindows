-give defaults instead of forcing lots of options up front (naming pages). IE: hide options better
- have a "create new page button" that opens a dialog

Database:
sanatize user input

--- Done ---

toogle "open latest" mode

drag and drop to iframe part to add to list.
imrove error handling
-problem with loading latest? Sometimes it doesn't catch it or something...
dragging:
- the hover target is often one below where it "should" be
- if the window is scrolled, it drops onto the wrong target.
allow reorder of posts.
